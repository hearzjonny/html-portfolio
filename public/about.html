<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr /> 
<p>Hey All,</p>
<p>
  My Name is Jon Heisler. I'm originally from central Florida.
   I am a former special forces operator looking for a job in website development. 
   
</p>

<p>Some of my favorite hobbies are lifting weights,
   snowboarding, and practicing martial arts.
  I  also plan to get my personal training license 
  so that I can help others acheive their goals in 
  my free time! </p>

<p>My motto is, I am strict with my goals, but flexible with my methods.
